  <p>This week's cultural reflection piece is about asking good questions. Here's what I know about questions:</p>

    <li><a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking?language=en">Asking for help</a> is about connection. It makes the asker vulnerable to their audience.</li>
    <li>The asker needs to trust that the askee (or group at large) will want to help them.</li>
    <li>Without trust and the willingness to be vulnerable, questions will not be as effective.</li>
    <li>Some of the most important questions are the ones we ask ourselves.</li>

  <p>This weekend I go to NYC to begin the onsite portion of Dev Bootcamp. In 9 short weeks, I'll begin job hunting. If I can be honest for a moment, I care deeply that I have a purpose in life. Too often, I shy away from asking myself the tough questions. I would like to take this opportunity to do that, so in 9 weeks I won't be swayed by all that glitters. I will be able to look back and reaffirm my reasons for choosing this path and make decisions about my future with confidence. </p>

  <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsXO9brK7M">How to Determine Your Life's Purpose (in under 5 minutes)</a></h3>

  <p>It's surprisingly simple, just answer the following 5 questions:</p>

  <ol class="add-border">
    <li>Who are you? (just your name)</li>
    <li>What do you love to do? (only one word!) (Alternatively - What is the one thing you feel supremely qualified to teach other people, right now?)</li>
    <li>Who do you do it for?</li>
    <li>What do these people want or need that you provide? (one or two words)</li>
    <li>How do they change or transform as a result of what you give them?</li>
  </ol>

  <p>For example, "My name is Kelly and I love to assemble solutions. I haven't decided who I do it for yet, but I have faith that there is a need in the world that I will be called to fill. As a result of my efforts,  I will make something better than it was before."</p>

  <h3><a href="http://blog.devbootcamp.com/2015/what-you-should-be-asking-about-culture-fit/">What Do You Need from Your Work Environment?</a></h3>
  
  <p>My inlination, as ever, is to compromise what I actually want in favor of safety, security, or comfort. I want to answer these questions right now, out on the internet, to discourage my future self from making those kinds of compromises.</p> 

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>Describe your ideal work environment / dream job situation.</td>
      <td>Highly collaborative, fast-paced, TDD work environment, with effective teams and superb leadership.  At this point in my education, I think that I will prefer work with Ruby or Python. I would like to work with happy people (wouldn't everyone?), and the work culture should support people in making their own lives better. Location is important to me.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do you want to work on a small or a large team?</td>
      <td>In the past, I've enjoyed working as a pair that belonged to a team of 5 in a subset of a larger team of 20-30. Something similar to that would be preferable.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do you excel when pair programming or do you prefer solo work?</td>
      <td>I like both equally, and would prefer a role where I was required to do both.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Are you interested in having your own private office or cubicle, or do you like open floor plans?</td>
      <td>I like open floor plans as long as there are quiet spaces I can go to recharge during the day. I've enjoyed having my own cubicle / office space in the past.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do you want direct instruction and management or more independence and self-initiative?</td>
      <td>I prefer direct management. In the past, I've been significantly more successful in my roles when I've had the opportunity to work with managers that have a more engaged managerial presence.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do you prefer a more casual office or a more professional one?</td>
      <td>I enjoy casual office spaces just as much as professional office spaces.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Do you want to dedicate a lot of your energy and time to a startup, or do you want a fixed 9 to 5 job?</td>
      <td>I would be thrilled at the chance to completely throw myself into a project or role. That being said, I don't necessarily want to work at a company that would regularly demand more than ~50 hours per week. Furthermore, I dislike working environments that prioritize facetime over productivity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Will you be satisfied with a hacky solution or do you prefer highly tested code?</td>
      <td>I would love to be on the far end of the "well-tested" spectrum.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Is having a diverse workplace important to you? How about mentorship or opportunities for professional development?</td>
      <td>I prefer working on teams that have a well-balanced M:F ratio. Mentorship is very important to me and mentorship opportunities, especially female mentors, are a huge plus. I prefer working in an environment where continuous improvement is woven into the culture of the workplace.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>How does the company display itâ€™s mission statement in daily life?</td>
      <td>They should live and breathe their mission statement. I prefer to play all-out.</td>
    </tr>

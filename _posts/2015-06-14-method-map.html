  <p>I'm quite new to the realm of Ruby. Don't get me wrong, I'm a hughe fan. There are just a few things (many, many things) that I don't quite understand yet. I'm going to throw some concept descriptions down below, but just so you know where I'm going with this - this post is about the Ruby 'map' method. It's a super-simple, super-useful method. See below for descriptions and examples.</p>
  
  <h2>Define</h2>

  <p>Alias - Methods with different names that operate identically. Often included out of consideration for programmers that use multiple languages (<code>map</code> and <code>collect</code> are aliases).</p>
  <p>Module - Modules are a way of grouping together methods, classes, and constants - like a package! Collection of code that someone has written that you can now use. Reuseable code. </p>
  <p>Mixin - ??? (like I said above, I don't know everything, yet)</p>
  <p>The Enumerable Module (the map method belongs to this module) - traversal (iterative), can do serching, sorting, and comparisons. Really Useful Stuff.</p>
  <p>The Map Method - Takes an array, performs a specified operation or operations on each element, returns a new array with new elements.
  <p>Destuctive vs. Nondestructive Methods - <code>map</code> is a nondestructive method, <code>map!</code> is a destructive method. The only difference between the two is that <code>map!</code> will change (destroy) the array you give it, and <code>map</code> will not. <code>map</code> will create and return a new Array instance with your new values.</p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  input_array = [1,2,3,4,5] # => [1,2,3,4,5]
  }
new_array = input_array.map { |i| i + 5 } # => [6,7,8,9,10]
input_array # => [1,2,3,4,5]
  {% endhighlight %}

  {% highlight ruby %}
  new_array = input_array.map! { |i| i + 5 } # => [6,7,8,9,10]
  }
input_array # => [6,7,8,9,10]
  {% endhighlight %}

  <h2>In Conclusion:</h2>

  {% highlight ruby %}
  new_array = input_array.map { |i| code block } 

# i = current array value, 
# i goes from input_array[0] to input_array[input_array.length - 1]
# code block = operations to perform with/on each array value
# => (arrow means 'returns') new array with values altered according to the code block 
{% endhighlight %}

  <p>Hopefully that made sense. Can anyone explain what a mixin is? (Edit - Read <a href="http://kripple.github.io/ruby-building-blocks">this post</a> I made about Modules, Classes, Namespace, and Mixins).</p>
